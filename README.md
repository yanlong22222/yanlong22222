### Hey, Iâ€™m Shuang!Â  ðŸ‘‹
<br/>

- An XR Developer, creative designer, interdisciplinary artist, and programmer.

- Currently, I am an Interactive Developer based in San Francisco Bay Area. Previously, I worked in UC Berkeley XR Lab on several projects - Virtual Bauer Wurster, BAMFA Augmented Time, Gear Adventure, and In-between, which were featured by The Daily Californian, The Plan, Bampfa, Berkeley Circus, Archinect, and Berkeley news.

- I have a Graduate Certification in New Media and a Master's Degree in Architecture from the University of California, Berkeley where I completed an inclusive and diverse curriculum including computer science, interaction design, and VR/AR. My experience is a mixture of immersive tech, human-computer interaction, visual design, and programming.
