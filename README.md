### Hey, I’m Shuang!  👋
<br/>

🎨 I am an interdisciplinary Product Designer passionate about human-centered and logic-driven design solutions. I lead cross-functional projects and drive user engagement through innovative design strategies.

💡 Currently, I am a product designer based in San Francisco Bay Area. Previously, I worked in UC Berkeley XR Lab on several projects.

🎓 I have a Graduate Certification in New Media and a Master's Degree in Architecture from the University of California, Berkeley where I completed an inclusive and diverse curriculum including computer science, interaction design, and VR/AR. My experience is a mixture of immersive tech, human-computer interaction, visual design, and programming..

🐱 Outside of work, I enjoy exploring the world with my two cats and trying new things I've never done before.
