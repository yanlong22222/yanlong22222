An XR Developer, creative designer, interdisciplinary artist, and programmer.

Previously, I worked in UC Berkeley XR Lab on several projects - Virtual Bauer Wurster, BAMFA Augmented Time, Gear Adventure, and In-between, which were featured by The Daily Californian, The Plan, Bampfa, Berkeley Circus, Archinect, and Berkeley news.
